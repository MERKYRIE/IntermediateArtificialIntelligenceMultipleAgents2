# Choices

## Dijkstra

"Use the Flow Field system, very efficient when there is one defined goal to reach for a large number of agents, for example, the enemy base."

## A*

"Using the A* algorithm, you can find the best path to get to the destination, avoiding obstacles and taking terrain constraints into account."
